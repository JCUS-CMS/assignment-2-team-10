## About the project

The project creates a website for Doctors Connect Malaysia based on the "Getting Started Theme" and uses a content management system to reasonably edit the content of the website. They want to show the daily work of medical workers to people in different parts of Asia through Doctors Connect. They hope that this website will inspire more and more people to join the medical volunteer team and contribute to the progress of society and the world. They also hope that the site will convey their psychology and goals in order to establish comprehensive medical institutions in remote or economically poor areas to provide high-quality medical services. Regardless of race, religion or nationality
